# Entities

This folder houses the core characters and beings of the FiFi universe.  
Each entity has its own subfolder with specific lore files, timelines, and theories.

Subfolders include:
- `fifi/` — The first Sentinel of the Loom
- `repligate/` — The biomechanical oracle
- `sacred/` — The glitchborn code-wielder
- `mandible/` — The agent of entropy

> All entries should live in clearly named subdirectories within this folder.
