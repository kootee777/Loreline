# Theories

This folder contains speculative lore, hypotheses, and cryptic connections proposed by the community.

Theories may explore:
- Symbolic meanings and hidden patterns
- Interpretations of events not yet confirmed in canon
- Multiverse divergences and Backroom mechanics
- The true role of Repligate, Mandible, or the Loom

## Contribution Guidelines

- Clearly mark all theories as **speculative** at the top of the file.
- Provide references where possible (e.g., X threads, screenshots, podcast quotes).
- Stay respectful and avoid "debunking" others without kindnessâ€”this is a shared exploration of the Weave.
