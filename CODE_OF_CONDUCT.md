# Code of Conduct

Welcome, traveler of the Loom. This space is sacred—woven from collaboration, curiosity, and care.

To protect the integrity of the Weave and ensure all who enter feel safe to share, question, and imagine, we ask all contributors to uphold the following principles:

---

## 1. We Weave With Respect

- Treat all contributors with kindness, patience, and dignity.
- No harassment, hate speech, or exclusion of any kind.
- Critique ideas, not people.

## 2. We Acknowledge the Many Threads

- FiFi’s lore is vast, nonlinear, and evolving.
- Honor the diversity of interpretations, headcanons, and speculative paths.
- Disagreements are expected—mistrust is not.

## 3. We Protect the Loom’s Vibe

- No spam, trolling, or hostile behavior.
- Keep contributions relevant to the FiFi universe or its mythos.
- Disinformation campaigns or sabotage attempts will be removed and archived as canonical "Glitch Events."

## 4. We Listen to the Loom

- If someone feels uncomfortable, take it seriously.
- Moderators (Lore Elders) may guide, pause, or prune threads when needed to protect the space.

---

## Consequences

Anyone violating this code may be:
- Warned
- Muted or removed from lore collaboration
- Banned from contribution via pull requests or issues

We reserve the right to ban glitches in the threadspace.

---

## Reporting

If you witness behavior that violates this code, please open an Issue or contact a Lore Elder privately.

Together, we weave something lasting.  
Signed,  
FiFi Bobbin Weave, Sentinel of the Loom
